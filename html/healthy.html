        <h4>NO.1 Obesity</h4>
        <p>According to clinical experience in pet hospitals, about one-third of pets are overweight. Heart disease in
          dogs is related to obesity and is a leading cause of death. The reason for obesity is often due to feeding
          pets high-calorie foods to please them, as well as a clear lack of space for activities and exercise provided
          by the owner. If the obesity is due to a lack of thyroid hormone, it can be managed by supplementing with
          trace elements to reduce the obesity.</p>

        <h4>NO.2 Infectious Diseases</h4>
        <p>Common fatal malignant infectious diseases in pets include canine distemper, canine parvovirus, feline
          panleukopenia, and feline calicivirus, among others. The primary reason for the high mortality from these
          diseases is the failure of owners to properly immunize their pets, coupled with allowing their pets to come
          into contact with infected dogs or cats. It is recommended to regularly vaccinate pets and, if a new cat or
          dog is added to the household, remember to first have a veterinarian conduct a health check and possibly
          quarantine the new pet for a period of observation.</p>

        <h4>NO.3 Accidents</h4>
        <p>Cats and dogs have a strong curiosity and love to explore, leading to various fatal accidents such as traffic
          accidents, electrocution, heatstroke, food poisoning, snake and bee stings, and chemical poisoning. Heatstroke
          is one of the most easily overlooked causes of death. Dogs regulate their body temperature through the
          evaporation of fluids from their tongues. When the environment becomes hot and humid, a dog's body temperature
          can rise dangerously.</p>

      <div>
        <img src="../images/4.jpeg" alt="" width="350px">
        <h4>NO.4 Malignant Tumors</h4>
        <p>In veterinary clinical diagnosis and treatment, malignant tumors in dogs are often overlooked, especially in
          older dogs, which are sometimes simply assumed to have died of old age. How can the incidence of malignant
          tumors be reduced? Spaying female dogs can decrease the incidence of mammary tumors, and neutering male dogs
          can reduce the occurrence of prostate cancer. Avoiding prolonged exposure to sunlight can prevent squamous
          cell carcinoma, and reducing the use of chemical dips can help avoid transitional cell carcinoma, among
          others.</p>

        <h4>
          NO.5 Canine Heartworm</h4>
        <p>Heartworms, which are about several centimeters long as adults, parasitize the heart of dogs and can be a
          fatal cause of illness. The mode of transmission is through mosquito bites, with older dogs having a higher
          risk of infection. In the early stages of heartworm disease, there are often no clinical symptoms. Common
          signs include reduced activity, coughing, and in severe cases, cachexia, such as anemia, ascites, and asthma.

        <h4>NO.6 Blood Parasites</h4>
        <p>Among the causes of death from blood parasites, babesiosis is one of the most serious. Babesiosis is a blood
          parasite disease transmitted by ticks, with the babesia being a protozoan that can only be seen under a
          microscope. The parasite resides in red blood cells, destroying them and causing hemolysis and severe anemia.
          Common prevention methods include regularly administering flea and tick preventives such as spot-on treatments
          or sprays to eliminate ticks from pets and prevent mosquito bites.</p>
